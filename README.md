# face_recognition
Jupyter Notebook that walks through face enrollment and recognition with the face_recognition library. It lets you register multiple people (stores 128-D encodings in a pickle file), then identify them in photos or live webcam streams—with bounding boxes and labels—while automatically versioning output images.
