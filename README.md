# Face Registration & Recognition Notebook

Small, self-contained Jupyter notebook that teaches you to **register faces and recognise them** with the popular [`face_recognition`](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) Python library.  
Everything lives in one file â€“ `face_registration_recognition.ipynb`.

* Stores 128-D encodings for each person in a single `encodings.pickle`.  
* Lets you enrol people **from a folder tree** *or* **one photo at a time**.  
* Identifies faces in a still image (Section 4) or live webcam feed (Section 5).
